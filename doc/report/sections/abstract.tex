There are a number of institutions in Norway conducting research, and an even larger number of units within those institutions.
In this paper, we introduce Ercin an exploration project where we look at the research connectivity within and between institutions in Norway. We takes advantage of Cristin\cite{CRISTIN-about} a research information system for Norway from where we extract information by crawling researchers and their results, before inserting the information into a graph database.
This enable exploring the data and provide valuable insights into the research connectivity in Norway.
We discovered that the top five institutions in Norway have great research connectivity between them.
Due to organizational structures, some institutions appear to be less connected across its units, displaying great connectivity within institutions as well for some, and inconclusive results for others.
