There are a number of institutions in Norway conducting research, and an even larger number of units within those institutions.
In this paper, we introduce Cristin\cite{CRISTIN-about} where information is extracted by crawling researchers and their results, before inserting the information into a graph database.
This enable exploring the data and provide valuable insights into the research connectivity in Norway.
We discovered that top five institutions in Norway have great research connectivity between them.
Due to organizational structures, some institutions appear to be less connected across its units, displaying great connectivity within institutions as well for some, and inconclusive results for others.
