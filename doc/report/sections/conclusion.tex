Through Cristin, there are large amounts of data available, which is extracted and inserted into a graph database to perform the queries for the purpose of examining research connectivity in Norway.
As the experimental results show, the research connectivity between institutions is great, around 2/3 of the results are collaborartions between authors from different institutions.
Relating this to connectivity within institutions and thus, between units of those institutions, the connectivity is very different from institution to institution.
This is most likely due to the different organizational structures of the institutions, where some institutions, such as UiO and UiT, comprise a large number of units while others, such as NTNU and NMBU are made up of far fewer units, leading to the inconclusive results.
